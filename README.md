### Features
***
- Reveals the origins of the infeasibilities in infeasible instances of the Virtual Network
Functions Chain Placement Problem (VNF-CPP).
- Makes it easy for network operators to understand the reasons behind the infeasibilities.
- Recommends how to modify the network to regain feasibility and allocate new services. 
- Supports real-time elastic resource management.
- Easy-to-use: output of the tool is reported visually and easy to understand.
